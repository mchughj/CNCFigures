# CNCFigures
This repository includes some CNC Files for simple wooden figures.

Some time ago I noticed advertisments for wooden figures that seemed pretty simple to replicate and an opportunity to make custom gifts for friends and family.  This repository contains those efforts.  

The different types of figures are divided into directories with readme files that contain example cuttings of the files.

Most of the time I cut the figures out of 4/4 wood but I've done as thin as 3/4 and as thick as 5/4.
